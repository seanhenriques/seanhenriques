### Hello, I'm [Sean Henriques](https://iadt.ie/about/staff/sean-henriques/) 👋🏻👨🏻‍💻

I'm an educational technologist who loves finding creative ways to use technology to help people learn and grow.  I love working on projects with `Databases`, `Data Visualisation` and `Web Engineering`.

I have been coding since 2008 when I started building online video games.  I have since earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/), and have been fortunate to work in both third-level universities and corporate businesses.
